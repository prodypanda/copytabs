## Structured File Tree

When enabled, a structured file tree is included at the top (or bottom) of the copied content, providing a clear overview of your project structure. This feature is especially useful when sharing your codebase with AI assistants or during code reviews.

## ü§ñ Example Workflow with AI Code Assistant

1. Open all relevant files in your VS Code project.
2. Enable Clipboard Mode if you want to paste directly into the AI assistant.
3. Use the extension to copy all tabs (or selected tabs).
4. Open your preferred AI code assistant (e.g., ChatGPT).
5. Paste the copied content and ask for code review, optimization suggestions, or any other coding assistance.

This workflow allows you to quickly provide full context to the AI assistant, leading to more accurate and helpful responses.

## üìä Copy Statistics

When copying tabs, you'll now see detailed statistics in the notification:
- ‚úÖNumber of successfully copied files
- ‚ùåNumber of failed files (if any)
- ‚ùåList of failed files (if any)
- üìäTotal token count (useful for AI assistants)

Example notification:
```
5 Tabs copied to clipboard!-‚úÖ Success: 5-üìä Tokens: 1,234
```

Or with failures:
```
3 Tabs copied to clipboard!-‚úÖ Success: 3-‚ùå Failed: 2-‚ùå Files: test.jpg, binary.exe-üìä Tokens: 567
```

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `copytabs.copyToClipboard`: Copy tabs content directly to clipboard instead of opening in a new tab (default: false).
